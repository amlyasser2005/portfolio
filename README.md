# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my first Front-End project using only HTML and CSS.  
I created this website by following a step-by-step tutorial to understand the basics of web development.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
- Simple and clean design
- Responsive layout
- Navigation bar and multiple sections

More updates and improvements will be added as I learn more.
